# linear_regression

In this project, linear regression is implemented utilizing various machine learning algorithms including:
1. Gradient Descent
2. Learning Curve
3. Implementing cost function
 
In addition, functionalities of *matplotlib* are widely used in order for **Visualizing Data**. Other library that I used for implementation is NumPy that provides us with **vectorization**.

#Proble Statement
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.

    You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
    The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
    You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant.
        For these cities, you have the city population.

Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?
