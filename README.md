# linear_regression

In this project, linear regression is implemented utilizing various machine learning algorithms including:
1. Gradient Descent
2. Learning Curve
3. Implementing cost function
 
In addition, functionalities of *matplotlib* are widely used in order for **Visualizing Data**. Other library that I used for implementation is NumPy that provides us with **vectorization**.
